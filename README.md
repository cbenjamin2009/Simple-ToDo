# Simple-ToDo
Simple ToDo Project based on Kyle's WebDevSimplified tutorial combined with Kevin Powell's html video, taken slightly further to add some additional functionality and different styling.  (Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7FaYfuwu70 & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhmSidOJSeE) 

This is a sample program, not intended as fully functional, but a great starter.

Note: Local storage is in use, may conflict with other testing you have done, be sure to update script.js if needed.
